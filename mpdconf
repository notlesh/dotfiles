# An MPD conf file meant to run on stock[-ish] Ubuntu with pulseaudio.
# music files go in ~/music and playlists in ~/music/playlists.
#
# A small modification to pulseaudio configuration is needed to allow
# MPD's TCP connections from localhost, see:
#
# https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/mpd/+bug/1354052
#
# Specifically, add the following line to /etc/pulse/default.pa:
# load-module module-native-protocol-tcp auth-ip-acl=127.0.0.1 auth-anonymous=1
#
# Then restart pulseaudio by killing it:
# pulseaudio -k
#
# Additionally, Ubuntu wants to run MPD as a service under the "mpd" user, so
# symlink this file (or copy) to /etc/mpd.conf
